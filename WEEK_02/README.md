WEEK 2 HOMEWORK //

1. Was having trouble with Openframeworks - very unfamilliar, but the end result was kind of nice.

2. Was trying to recreate Assignment 2 from last week (lines following a mouse) but failed completely. 
Had trouble with creating an array (can't figure out the syntax) -I'd love your help with this one!

3. The size of the character is controlled by the gui, the color by a sine wave.
Couldn't understand why it seems to move sideways when following the move (want to fix that).
