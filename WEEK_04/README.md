  So far, the app has two scenes - both are vertex shaders reacting to audio input in different ways; the first scene (blue) has a gui to control the radius of the sphere.
  issues:   the gui does not display properly (the title and slider are missing)
            wanted to make a gui to control the "blurriness" of the sphere
