## // WEEK 5

// assignment 1: i was going for a "snake-like" generative drawing - turned out more like pipes, telephone wires, machine-like:

// possibly for research prject: using arduino + light sensor to control the height of the generative drawing:

// assignment 2: physics, collisions, particle systems:

## // complete app

## // the app:
- press space to start
- switch between modes using 1-3, go back to start with 0
- plays an audio excerpt of Buckminster Fuller speaking about "Spaceship Earth"
- mode 1: shader sphere with terrain mapped as texture, reacts to app audio and live audio
- gui to control the radius of the circle and volume of audio file
- mode 2: plane/terrain shader, also reacts to live audio (the terrain is an areial view of Bure, France)
- mode 3: takes camera input and translates the pixel data into lines, depending on pixel brightness

## // app issues:
- mode 3 doesn't go fullscreen
- couldn't get any nice OF addons to work on windows :(
